> **Empowering children's creativity — turning their imagination into magical realities through AI.**

----------

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

----------

## 🎯 Objective

While much attention is focused on the future of AI, we believe the real future lies with our children.  
**ImaginationBook** is a creative canvas where children can draw, write, and recite freely. Instead of simply prompting AI, they _create_ — and our advanced AI brings their amateur work to life by generating rich, beautiful images from their imagination.  
We empower kids to become creators, not just users.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:

`SERP`

### Team Members:

-   **Prantik Sanki** (Full Stack Developer)
    
-   **Soham Pahari** (AI Developer)
    

### Our Approach:

-   We chose this problem because fostering creativity at a young age is crucial for building a better, more innovative future.
    
-   Key challenges we addressed:
    
    -   Handling multiple API keys simultaneously
        
    -   Building a safe, intuitive, and child-friendly UI
        
    -   Setting up efficient real-time image generation from inputs
        
-   Major breakthroughs:
    
    -   Seamlessly connecting freeform child inputs to visual outputs using a lightweight AI pipeline.
    
-   Limitations:
    
    -   Due to GPU use limit, we can use GPU for a short time each day.
